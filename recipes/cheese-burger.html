    <h2>Descriprion</h2>
    <p>A cheeseburger is the ultimate comfort food, combining a juicy, tender beef patty 
        with the irresistible melt of cheese. The savory richness of the patty pairs perfectly 
        with a slice of gooey cheese, usually cheddar, American, or Swiss, adding a creamy, tangy layer 
        to every bite. Sandwiched between a soft, toasted bun, it's often topped with classic condiments 
        like ketchup, mustard, and pickles, along with fresh lettuce, tomato, and onions for a burst of 
        crunch and freshness. The combination of textures—from the soft bun to the charred patty and melted 
        cheese—creates a satisfying and flavorful experience that never goes out of style</p>
