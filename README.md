# odin-recipes
I created a website featuring three delicious recipes: pizza, a hamburger, and a burrito. The website's home page (index.html) serves as a central hub, linking to separate pages for each recipe. I made sure to include an ordered list for each recipe's ingredients and instructions, enhancing the readability and organization of the content. To make the site visually appealing, I added relevant images to each page, showcasing the finished dishes. Throughout the development process, I used Git to commit after every major change, ensuring smooth version control and tracking of my progress. I also double-checked all the links between the pages to ensure they were working properly, creating a seamless user experience.
